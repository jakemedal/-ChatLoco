    <h3 class="off-white">How do I join a chatroom?</h3>
    <p>Chatrooms are made and joined based on your current location. After logging in, your current coordinates
    are loaded into our chatroom creation system. After picking your user handle, you submit your query to join
    a chatroom near you!
    </p>

    <h3 class="off-white">What if I want to join a room with my friend but he's in Tijuana and I'm stuck in Milwaukee freezing?</h3>
    <p>
        You should be able to manually enter coordinates into the chatroom finder. Ask your pal to provide you with 
        the coordinates of their chatroom and you shouldn't have a problem joining them.
